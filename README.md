## Introduction
The last 18 months have seen many of us confined to our homes for extended periods of time, and increasingly our homes are in urban settings with little or no green outside space. These are some of the reasons attributed to a recent surge in interest in houseplants. There are numerous benefits to keeping houseplants: they are relatively inexpensive; they allow us to connect with nature, they satisfy our primal urges to care and nurture, and in the uncertain times created by the global pandemic, they offer a sense of calm reassurance to many people. Best of all, you can talk to them  (and of course, they don’t answer you back!)

So what are the downsides I hear you cry, it can’t all be blissful green-fingered-fun? Well, caring for houseplants can be tricky. I have certainly presided over the decline of one (or two!?) in my time, but thankfully with a bit of basic guidance and species specific knowledge, anybody can successfully grow a healthy houseplant.

Plant Base is an interactive web application that gives users access to a wealth of information on caring for houseplants. Users will be able to access recipe style cards or ‘tip-sheets’, which contain useful information on caring for a variety of houseplants. Users will be able to search for specific plants. They will be encouraged to create an account so that they can build their own personal collections, where they will also be able to upload and edit their own tip sheets to be shared with other users.

## User Experience

Here I will address the aims and goals of the application from both the perspectives of the user and of the owner. I will also address how user experience is key to the design of the application.
