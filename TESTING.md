# Plant Base - Testing 

[View deployed site here](https://plant-base-project.herokuapp.com/)
[README.md]( https://github.com/AledPeart/plant-base/blob/main/README.md)

I have tested my deployed site to ensure that it achieves the intended aims of the owner and the expectations of the users by meeting the user stories detailed in the [README.md]( https://github.com/AledPeart/plant-base/blob/main/README.md). I have also manually tested the deployed site across a number of different devices and browsers to ensure that the design, layout and functionality respond as intended. In addition the validity of my HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python code have been checked using the [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) , [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) and [PEP8]( https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) respectively . Finally I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools to test the accessibility and performance of my site. The specific tests and results are detailed below:

## Responsiveness

The site has been designed with a mobile first approach, and great care has been taken throughout the development process to ensure that the site responds well across all viewing devices. Bootstrap ‘breakpoints’ have been adhered to ensure consistency in the design layouts, and this has been extensively tested using [ChromeDevTools]( https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) both throughout development and on completion of the build. Some custom CSS media queries have been used to improve the responsiveness of the design reducing padding as appropriate and to allow some text to fit neatly within the design space as intended. e.g

```
/* following media query to reduce font size on smaller screens */

@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
    .quick-facts-card {
        font-size: 0.8rem;
        padding:    0;
    }
}
```
I have tested my site across various screen widths in order to best replicate the breadth of modern viewing devices, and in line with the Bootstrap breakpoints that were used in the design, namely:

    Extra Small <576px
    Small 576-768px
    Medium 768-992px
    Large 992-1200px
    Extra Large >1200px

Additional testing was carried out on the physical devices that I have access to:
 
    A large screen desktop
    Laptop
    Tablet
    Mobile device

And on the following browsers:

    Chrome
    Firefox
    Safari (ios)

Further responsiveness testing was done using [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/)

## Code Validation

While developing and for final checks I have validated my code using the following validation tools. On submission no errors were shown: 

HTML - [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/)    
CSS - [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)     No Errors were found         
![CSS](static/images/cas-validation.png) 

Javascript -[JSHint]( https://jshint.com/)   1 unused function warning - this function is being called but from outside the script file. I have also added *jshint esversion: 6 */ as Jshint is defaulting to an earlier version  

![JSHint](static/images/jshint.png)   

Python – [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)  Corrected numerous erros such as 'trailing whitespace' and reducing line length to be PEP8 compliant  

![PEP8]( static/images/pep8-validation-check.png)  

## Lighthouse Testing

I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools to test the accessibility and performance of my site. The results are as follows:   

Home     
![Home](static/images/home-page-lighthouse.png)

## Testing Results and Bugs

I was regularly testing my code during the development process and as such a number of bugs and errors were found and fixed that way. I have detailed the more significant ones here, and those that were found during testing, as well as some that are as yet unresolved.

### Resolved Bugs

#### Homepage image overlay issue

My original design for the homepage had a text box sitting on top of an image. The following Javascript function was written to ensure that on smaller devices my text box would sit underneath the homepage image by removing the Bootstrap overlay class
```
let $homeBox = $('.home-box');

$(window).resize(function() {
  if (window.innerWidth >= 992) $homeBox.addClass('card-img-overlay');
  else $homeBox.removeClass('card-img-overlay');
});

```
This appeared to work, and when testing my site's layout and responsiveness on DevTools I did not find any issues, however on a physical mobile device, sometimes the text box would cover the main image completely. If the phone was rotated then the issue would resolve itself. I also saw this issue when testing with Responsinator.

Ideally, and with the luxury of more time, I would like to havbe resolved this issue, but I have had to ensure that the mobile homepage renders correctly by re-writing the HTML/CSS, so that the text now sits permanently below the image. 

#### Validation Issue - email address

This error was caught while manually testing the functionality of my registration form. I had not set the ‘type = email’, instead it was set to ‘text’ so was not requiring the user to input their email in an accepted format. This was a straightforward fix.

#### Displaying the username next to the user icon in the navigation bar.

Adding this feature caused an issue whereby I had not defined the username within the route function in app.py. By adding them as variables and passing them correctly when rendering the page templates, as shown here
```
return redirect(url_for("get_sheets"))
    username = mongo.db.users.find_one(
        {"username": session["user"]})["username"]
    return render_template("add_sheet.html", username=username,
                           categories=categorie
``` 
#### Required attribute on the edit_sheet form

When passing the HTML code through the W3 validation check the following error message was found:

```
Error: The first child option element of a select element with a required attribute, and without a multiple attribute, and without a size attribute whose value is greater than 1, must have either an empty value attribute, or must have no text content. Consider either adding a placeholder option label, or adding a size attribute with a value equal to the number of option elements.
```
As I have dropdown boxes, when a user edits a sheet, the existing values are prepopulated ready for them, but this is was causing issues in the validation. For them not to be pre-populated would mean a very poor user experience for the user as they would have to re-enter all the information. The ‘placeholder’ and adding a ‘value >’ 1 did not work in this case and would only serve to confuse the user. So I have removed the required tag, as all the information has already been entered and there is no longer an option to leave the form blank. This resolved the issue.

#### Pagination issue on the users profile

I encountered an error with my pagination function and the way it was applying to the user profile page. The function was working perfectly for the sheets page, displaying the correct number of sheets per page. However on the profile page this was not the case. The sheets were only displaying one per page. After some digging I discovered that I was requiring all sheets that the user had created I had to amend the command to the database to only return sheets created by the session user

```
sheets = list(mongo.db.sheets.find({"created_by": session["user"]}))
```

#### Users being able to force entry onto pages that should have been restricted

It was pointed out to me by my mentor that certain pages allowed users who were not logged in, or who were logged in but did not own a particular sheet, to edit or delete sheets. I understand now that hiding those options on the front end is not the same as including measures inside the backend functionality to prevent this. This was addressed by adding checks inside the relevant functions, to ensure that only users who were logged in or who had created particular sheets could perform certain functionality, along with customised flash messages to inform the user.

```
# check if the user is logged in
    if "user" not in session:
        flash("Please Login in order to continue")
        return redirect(url_for("login"))

    # then check that this user is the owner of the sheet
    elif session["user"] != owner and session["user"] != "admin":
        flash("You do not have permission to edit this sheet")


```

#### Search pagination issue

![pagination error]( static/images/pagination-search-error.png)

I was receiving the above error when my search results were large enough to be paginated. I spent a lot of time trying to solve this including removing and re-installing the search indexes in MongoDB. I eventually found the cause was the query not being passed through properly to the second paginated page and beyond. The solution came from a fellow student on slack who had encountered the same thing on his project !( https://github.com/Edb83/self-isolution) The solution involved redefining the query variable and in the search function to ```query = request.args.get("query")```, as well as removing the "POST" and "GET" methods completely and changing the method in the search form from "POST" to "GET".


### Unresolved Bugs

#### Image URL Validation

A huge learning experience for me as part of this project has been attempting to implement effective validation of the user inputted image URLs. The challenges were threefold. Firstly to ensure that the users were inputting a valid URL, secondly that the URL was linked to an actual image, and if it was not (if it was broken for example or if there were an error) to ensure that a default placeholder image was loaded. 
In terms of validating the input as a URL, setting type to = URL means that the users input must be in a valid format. Determining if a string is actually an image has not been so straightforward. 

I attempted this firstly by using the url.split() method, to split the string at the final”.” And then compare the extension to my list of accepted formats within the following function:

```
def check_url(url):
format = url.split(".")

if format[-1] not in ["jpg", "png", "jpeg"]:
flash("That URL doesn't seem to link to a valid image. Please try again")
else:
return url

```
After a whole day of tweaking and trying to make this work I simply couldn’t get the outcome I needed. I exhausted a lot of tutor support and in the end I was getting an unexpected bson error:

![bson error]( static/images/bson-error.png)

It was at this point that I decided to explore other options. Following a chat with my mentor I explored using the flask requests library to query URL using a function that was to be tweaked from something found on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10543940/check-if-a-url-to-an-image-is-up-and-exists-in-python

The function was as collows
```
if request.method == "POST":
	            user_input_image = request.form.get("image")
	            accepted_image_formats = ("image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/jpg")
	            r = requests.head(user_input_image)
	            if r.headers["content-type"] in accepted_image_formats:
	                final_image = user_input_image
	            else:
	                final_image = "static/images/placeholder-image-potted.jpg"
```
I was able to get this working but on initial testing it was proving too unstable.  I was receiving the following error:
```
requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL ‘’: No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http://

```
and also if  the link was broke, rather than load the default image I was getting this error:

```
urllib3.exceptions.LocationParseError: Failed to parse: 'images.unsplash.co=mnwxmja3fdb8mhxzzwfyy2h8mzr8fgnhy3rpfgvufdb8fdb8fa%3d%3d&ixlib=rb-2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60', label empty or too long

```

At this stage, due to time pressures I had to admit defeat and remove the function.

As a solution I have settled on ensuring that users are required to add a URL, so that there is a value in the database. To help users I have added the default image URL as a placeholder in the form input field, with instruction that this can be left as a default if the user does not have a preferred image. As a secondary precaution the default image is rendered to the page if there is an error by using the ‘onerror’ image attribute:
```
onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='static/images/placeholder-image-potted.jpg'"
```
Furthermore to prevent an empty src attribute on the image tag the following conditional statement has been added to the applicable html pages:

```
{% if sheet.image %} 
                        <a href="{{ url_for('view_sheet', sheet_id=sheet._id) }}"><img src="{{ sheet.image }}" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='static/images/placeholder-image-potted.jpg'" class="sheet-image" alt="image of a {{ sheet.common_name }}"></a> 
                    {% else %} 
                        <a href="{{ url_for('view_sheet', sheet_id=sheet._id) }}"><img src="{{url_for('static',filename = '/images/placeholder-image-potted.jpg')}}" 
                            class="sheet-image" alt="image of a {{ sheet.common_name }}"></a>
                    {% endif %}
```
