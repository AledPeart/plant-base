# Plant Base - Testing 

[View deployed site here](https://plant-base-project.herokuapp.com/)
[README.md]( https://github.com/AledPeart/plant-base/blob/main/README.md)

I have tested my deployed site to ensure that it achieves the intended aims of the owner and the expectations of the users by meeting the user stories detailed in the [README.md]( https://github.com/AledPeart/plant-base/blob/main/README.md). I have also manually tested the deployed site across a number of different devices and browsers to ensure that the design, layout and functionality respond as intended. In addition the validity of my HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python code have been checked using the [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) , [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) and [pep8]( https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) . Finally I have used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) in Chrome DevTools to test the accessibility and performance of my site. The specific tests and results are detailed below:

##Responsiveness

The site has been designed with a mobile first approach, and great care has been taken throughout the development process to ensure that the site responds well across all viewing devices. Bootstrap ‘breakpoints’ have been adhered to ensure consistency in the design layouts, and this has been extensively tested using [ChromeDevTools]( https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) both throughout development and on completion of the build. Some custom CSS media queries have been used to improve the responsiveness of the design reducing padding as appropriate and to allow some text to fit neatly within the design space as intended. e.g

```
/* following media query to reduce font size on smaller screens */

@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
    .quick-facts-card {
        font-size: 0.8rem;
        padding:    0;
    }
}
```
I have tested my site across various screen widths in order to best replicate the breadth of modern viewing devices, and in line with the Bootstrap breakpoints that were used in the design, namely:

Extra Small <576px
Small 576-768px
Medium 768-992px
Large 992-1200px
Extra Large >1200px

Additional testing was carried out on the physical devices that I have access to:
 
    A large screen desktop
    Laptop
        Tablet
Mobile device

And on the following browsers:

    Chrome
    Firefox
    Safari (ios)

Further responsiveness testing was done using [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/)

## Code Validation

While developing and for final checks I have validated my code using the following validation tools: 

HTML - [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/)    
CSS - [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)     
Javascript -[JSHint]( https://jshint.com/)    
Python – [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
